To use vision with a fake mode
==============================

Need to set the following options:
```
VISION:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_OPENCV:BOOL=ON
LOWLEVEL:BOOL=OFF
MOTION:BOOL=OFF
VISION_ALONE=ON
```

Then, jump to the appropriate folder in environments (.../fake)

Then call RhobanServer: `.../.../RhobanServer`
