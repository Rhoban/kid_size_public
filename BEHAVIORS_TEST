# TESTS

## No referee mode

- When referee is not received, the robot should be playing state
- If it fall, it should standup

## Initial phase

- When referee is on and the game did not begin, it should be in INITIAL phase
and the robot should not move

## Placing phase

- When referee is in READY mode, the robot should walk to its place
- If it fall, it should continue walking
- If the place is not reached until the time, the robot should stop moving

## Freeze phase

- When referee is in SET mode, the robot should not move, waiting for the begining
of the game
- If it falls, it should standup

## Robot handling

- If the robot is handled during the INITIAL phase, it should not change anything
- If the robot is handled during the READY or SET phase, it should note it and reset
its filter on the goal line when the game starts

## Penalized

- If penalized, the robot should stop playing
- It still stands up (XXX ?)

## Unpenalized

- If the robot is unpenalized, it should start playing again

## Game start

- During the first seconds of the game (or after being unpenalized), the robot walks
  to the center of the field if it doesn't see the ball

## Drop ball

- If a goal is scored, the robot goes back to its placing
- In case of dropped ball, the same behavior applies

## End of half

- At the end of the half, the robot should go back to the INITIAL state and wait

## Kick off respect

- If we don't have the kick off, our robot should not enter the center circle during
  the 10 first seconds of game

## Letting play

- If another player, more near or with greatest priority handles the ball, the robot
  should let it play (and remain within its team radius)

## Searching for the ball

- If the robot doesn't know were is the ball, it looks around it
- If it doesn't see the ball, it will then go to patrol
- If another player sees the ball and share it, the player should walk to the shared ball

## Still undefined behaviour or things to fix

- When we know where is the ball but don't know where we are
- When we go for a shared ball, arrive, but still doesn't see the ball
- We should not kick the ball to the center of the goal when it it already in the goal
- When we are letting the other players handle the ball, we should do something more clever
