* Perception and localisation manual

Created on: June 3rd, 2018

This manual aims at providing basic knowledge on the Vision and Localisation
modules developed by the Rhoban team for RoboCup KidSize league.

We distinguish here two different modules:
- Perception: For everything related to treatment of images and acquisition of information
- Localisation: Ensuring time coherency and using perception information to
  build a reliable position estimation

** Perception

First we discuss here the main components of the perception, then we present the
detection of the different object present on the field, e.g. the ball and the
posts. Finally we present information on the tuning and diagnostic procedures to
improve the performances of the perception system.

*** Software components

**** Vision filters and Pipelines
The perception of the robot is structured by a pipeline of various
filters. At every new image, the pipeline is updated, starting from the root
(the source image) and ensuring that all dependencies have been compiled.

The content of the pipeline is read from the file *vision_config.json*,
instanciation of the objects is ensured by a Factory.
- Vision/Filters/Filter.hpp contains the definition of the base class for filters
- Vision/Filters/Pipeline.hpp contains the definition of the Pipeline
- Vision/Filters/Filter/* contains the implementation of the different filters

**** Camera State
While computer vision allows to detect the position of an object in an image, it
is mandatory to have information on the camera model and on its position (height
and direction) to transform the information from the image basis to the position
in the robot referential. The *CameraState* module at Vision/CameraState ensures
a proper reading of the position of the camera, provided by the ModelService.

The accuracy of the camera state is entirely dependent on the model of the
camera.

**** Binding/RoboCup

This component ensures that the perception pipeline is updated regularly, it is
also in charge of gathering all the useful information from the pipeline. It
stores the information until the LocalisationBinding retrieves them.

This binding also filters the information concerning the ball and the the robot.

*** Detection of objects
The acquisition of images is performed by the filter SourcePtGrey which
retrieves YUV images from the camera. The configuration files for the pipeline
are separated by type of object and are available inside the
environment/common/vision_filters folder.

The global configuration of the filter is set in the 'all.json'. Other
configuration files are discussed later

**** Colors and Integral Images
A few color segmentation filters are used in the pipeline, mainly to filter the
white and green parts of the image which are the most important colors.

We use Integral Images for those colors and for the Y component of the images in
order to allow more efficient computations for other obstacles.

Those filters are listed in the file colors.json

**** Ball
The detection of the balls is contained in the ball_detection.json file. It
follows the following procedure.
1. Identifying ROI based on two information (ballByII)
   - Expected size of the ball (according to camerastate)
   - Color information (ball is bright and it is a hole in the green)
2. Extracting the ROI from a RGB image (ballPatchProvider)
3. Classification of the ROI using a neural network (ballByDNN)
   - Accepted ROI are colored in green,
   - Refused ROI are colored in red

**** Posts
The detection of the base of the goalposts is contained in the goals.json file. It
follows the following procedure.
1. Identifying ROI based on two information (goalROIProvider)
   - Expected size of the base of the post (according to camerastate)
     - Note: instead of computing the size of the base of a post we simply
       multiplies the size of the ball to reduce the computation requirement
   - Color information (searching for a vertical white zone in the middle of the green)
2. Extracting the ROI from a RGB image (goalPatchProvider)
3. Classification of the ROI using a neural network (goalByDNN)
   - Accepted ROI are colored in green,
   - Refused ROI are colored in red

**** Robots
The detection of other robots is contained in the robots.json file. It
follows the following procedure.
1. Identifying ROI based on two information (obstacleByII)
   - Expected size of the base of the robot (according to camerastate)
     - Since the size of the feet of the robot depend on the opponent, we simply
       used a manually tuned scale factor from the size of the ball
   - Color information (searching for a vertical dark hole in the field which is not white)
2. Extracting the ROI from the Y canal of the image (obstaclePatchProvider)
3. Classification of the ROI using a neural network (obstacleByDNN)
   - Accepted ROI are colored in green,
   - Refused ROI are colored in red

*** Diagnostic and tuning of perception
While the perception system is quite robust, it is always possible to improve
it. Moreover, depending on the lightning condition, it might be necessary to
change the exposure time of the image acquisition.

**** Viewing filters output
Visualizing the images at different points of the pipeline is a convenient way
to identify issues and to tune parameters in the perception system.

In order to do so, it is possible to use the *view* command in a RhIO
Shell. Every filter is a directory inside the *Vision* node.

Note that it is much more convenient to use an ethernet cable for monitoring
images.

**** Acquiring logs
In order to tune up some parameters in specific situations or to obtain new
patches for training the neural networks, it is useful to acquire images
directly from the robot and to replay them later

The simplest way to acquire new logs is to use the script *start_manual_log.php*
in the folder *workspace/tools*. This script makes the robot scan continuously,
reduces the framerate of the Vision to avoid having too much similar images and
launch a log session of the required duration. Note that images are not taken
when the robot is not on the ground. Once the log is finished, the robot will
stop scanning.

The content of the log will be:
- A list of images corresponding to the source content
- A file containing the timestamps corresponding to the images
- A file containing the low level information (motors, pressure sensors etc)
  - This file is necessary to be able to obtain the orientation of the camera
    during the replay

**** Replaying logs
First move toward the folder *environments/fake*. Then, use the
script *prepare.sh* to setup the environments properly for the log and the robot
chosen. After that, you can replay the log using *run.sh*.

Note: It is mandatory to choose which pipeline is used to replay the logs. The
default choice is *common/vision_filters/all_fake.json*.

**** Tuning up the camera exposition
In order to change the exposure time, the procedure is the following:

1. Launch a robot and place it on the field
2. Open a rhio shell to view Vision/human/out
3. Open a rhio shell to tune the parameters in Vision/source.
   - Shutter is the aperture time in ms
     - A low aperture time results in less blur, but darker images
   - Gain controls the physical gain on images brightness
     - A higher gain implies a higher chromatical noise
4. Once the parameters are satisfying, modify the *all.json* file to make sur
   that changes will be taken into account

**** Training new neural network
The quality of the neural network can be improved by adding more data. We will
describe the procedure to use for improving the quality of the classification.

***** Extracting patches
First, patches have to be extracted. This can be done by:

1. Moving to folder *environments/fake*
2. Ensuring that *vision_config.json* points toward *common/vision_filters/roi_extractor.json*
3. Run the script *extract_patches.sh*

All the patches will be placed at *patches/results/patches.zip*, the next step
is to upload the files and tag the patches using rhoban.com/tag

***** Training neural networks
For this procedure, see the documentation in the package *deep_vision*

** Localisation

The robot uses a particle filter for localisation.
- Vision/Localisation/Field/ contains all the code relevant to the particle filter
- Vision/Binding/LocalisationBinding contains the interface of the localisation
  module with other modules

*** Main principle

The update of the particle filter is scheduled at a fixed frequency controled by
the parameter *localisation/period*.

At each period, the following procedure is applied:

1. Information are retrieved from the perception module and summarized
2. The particles are moved according to the odometry information
3. Some extra noise is added to the position of the particles
4. The particles are weighted according to the observation perceived
5. Particles for the next generation are chosen randomly according to weights

Additionally, information from the referee are used in specific procedures, see
'Reset and special events'

*** Observations

The observations used are:
- The base of the goal post
- The border and the corner of the field (green area)
- The visual compass (orientation of the robot based on global environment)

*** Reset and special events

There are many specific events which have a major impact on localisation, they 
are adressed specifically by 'reset' functions

**** Beginning of the game
At the beginning of the game, we can place the robots at a chosen location,
thus we initialize the particle filter at the location given by the *startup.sh*
script.

**** Border reset (after penalized or bad location)
When a robot comes back to the field after having been penalized or when it was
placed manually during the 'SET' phase, it enters on the field from the side, in
front of the penalty mark. This information is used to generate two clusters of
particles, one on each side of the field.

**** Fall reset
Falling and standing up introduces a large amount of noise on the position of
the robot, therefore, when the robot stand up, extra noise is added on the
particles, because perception is required to have an accurate orientation again.

*** Monitoring the localisation
The status of the particle filter can be monitored using rhio, a node containing
an image is provided in *localisation/TopView*
